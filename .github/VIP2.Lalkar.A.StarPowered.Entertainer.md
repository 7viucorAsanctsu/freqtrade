The film follows the story of Raghuvaran (Dhanush), a civil engineer who works for a construction company called Anitha Constructions. He is a loyal and hardworking employee who has won the Engineer of the Year award for his innovative projects. However, his life takes a turn when he faces a ruthless corporate rival, Vasundhara Parameshwar (Kajol), who is the owner of a leading construction company called Vasundhara Constructions. She is impressed by Raghuvaran's work and offers him a job in her company, but he politely declines. This triggers a war between the two companies, as Vasundhara tries to sabotage Raghuvaran's projects and reputation. Meanwhile, Raghuvaran also has to deal with his personal issues, such as his marriage with Shalini (Amala Paul), who wants him to quit his job and start his own business.
 
The film is a typical masala entertainer that relies on the star power of Dhanush and Kajol, who share a crackling chemistry on screen. The film has some humorous moments, especially in the first half, where Raghuvaran interacts with his colleagues and family. The film also has some catchy songs composed by Sean Roldan and Anirudh Ravichander. However, the film suffers from a weak plot, predictable twists and cliched dialogues. The film also drags in the second half, where the conflict between Raghuvaran and Vasundhara becomes repetitive and boring. The film also fails to explore the social issues that it touches upon, such as corruption, unemployment and environmental degradation.
 
VIP-2 Lalkar may work for people seeking star-powered entertainers. But otherwise, it gets lost in translation[^2^].

The film also marks the comeback of Kajol to Tamil cinema after 20 years. She plays the role of a powerful and arrogant businesswoman who clashes with Raghuvaran. She delivers a convincing performance and matches Dhanush in every scene. She also looks glamorous and stylish in her outfits and accessories. However, her character is not well-written and lacks depth and motivation. She is portrayed as a one-dimensional villain who hates Raghuvaran for no apparent reason.
 
Dhanush, on the other hand, reprises his role of Raghuvaran from the first film. He is the hero of the masses who fights for justice and honesty. He is charming and charismatic in his role and carries the film on his shoulders. He also showcases his versatility by singing, dancing and performing stunts. He also shares a good rapport with Amala Paul, who plays his wife. She has a limited role but does justice to it. She is cute and bubbly in her scenes and supports Raghuvaran in his endeavors.
 
The film also has a supporting cast of actors who play Raghuvaran's friends, family and colleagues. They include Samuthirakani, Vivek, Hrishikesh, Saranya Ponvannan, Ritu Varma and others. They add some comic relief and emotional quotient to the film. They also help Raghuvaran in his battle against Vasundhara.
